All code was derived from in-class activities with analagous scenarios.

# PyCity Schools Analysis

15 schools were analyzed: 8 charter and 7 district. 

The top 5 performers were charter with overall passing greater than 90% 

In contrast, the bottom 5 performers were district schools with overall passing around 53%.

Per student budgets show that financial constraints should not be considered in gauging student success.

My recommendation would be to dedicate more time in evaluating the math curriculum & teaching strategy as a top priority for district schools.

Lastly, charter schools have less total students so my follow-up analysis would focus on whether smaller class room sizes, in math specifically, would be feasible for district schools. While reducing the total students is not possible, it would be worth considering the cost in increasing the number of math teachers in order to reduce math class sizes.
